# The Economist Digital Solutions best coding practices

DRAFT

This is not a style guide. 
This is a guide of coding best practices and processes applicable to every development team that is part of Digital Solutions (DS) of The Economist Group.


## Why should we have such a guide?

DS is composed of internal, external and consultancy developers that work across different projects in a fast pace environment.

Alternacy of developers in several projects is not unusual, and we all agree that is a good thing for the following reasons:

- Experiences contamination: Devs can learn each other from their previous experiences
- Cross Skills pollination: Devs can learn from other devs with different functional skills
- Boredom annihilation: Moving to new projects is a natural stimulus for developers. 

All this point easily drive to advantages for the company: better developers + happier developer = better code and less people that go away

As a consequence of the above considerations, a set of well defined best practices and processes will reduce the time to on-board new developers on existing or new projects. The same will apply also to brand new hired developers.
